## FILES

Short_generation.mid -> A quick small generation with close to default settings
continued_Short_generation.mid -> Continued demo of Short_generation

## how to listen
just open any of these `.mid` files with:
- your os's default midi player
- online midi players (midiano works well)
## USE THIS TO BOOST SOUND IF TOO LOW ^
- import into garageband/fl studio/ableton if you want to mess with them

## notes

the model was trained on classical piano music, so outputs tend to have that vibe. sometimes it gets a bit repetitive or loses the thread, but overall it's decent for a relatively small model trained from scratch.

if you generate your own samples with `generate.py`, you'll get different results each time due to the randomness in the sampling process.
